              Desert beauty, declicious food, stunning architecture, relaxing
              spas, and vibrant nightlife
            </h3>
            <p>
              Scottsdale is a desert city in Arizona east of state capital
              Phoenix. It's known for its spa resorts and golf courses,
              including TPC Scottsdale. Farther north, trails wind through
              McDowell Sonoran Preserve, a desertscape of hills, rock formations
              and cacti. Nearby is Taliesin West, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s
              former home and studio. Downtown's Old Town Scottsdale has 1920s
              buildings and 19th-century olive trees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Old Town Scottsdale is the vibrant heart of the city. Nestled
              within nine walkable neighborhoods you’ll find a unique collection
              of shops, restaurants, art galleries and nightclubs, as well as
              contemporary public art installations, world-class museums and
              historic sites from the late 1880s. It’s this effortless blend of
              urban chic and Old West charm that gives Scottsdale’s downtown its
              one-of-a-kind flair.
